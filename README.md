# pyclutter
Fully distributed twitter built on holochain: port to Python in process

See https://github.com/holochain/clutter for the code that is being ported.

This is a work in progress. It can be built and tested and it works the same as clutter.

Currently there is a performance penalty for using Python in Zomes.

If you don't understand what this is about, please see the clutter page linked above.

Not for any sort of production use whatsoever, no warrantee express or implied.
